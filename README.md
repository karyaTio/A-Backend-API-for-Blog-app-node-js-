my personal project of creating a blog, i guess i start from creating backend service for my blog.
the purpose of this project is to learn backend programming and to finish a roadmap from https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap

## Progress

### Posts API

    - GET  : api/posts/     Get all post
    - POST : api/posts/     Create a post
    - GET  : api/posts/:id  Get a spesific post by id
    - POST : api/:id/update Update a post by id
    - POST : api/:id/delete Delete a post by id

### Note

#### Cant use PUT or DELETE method

my server does not allowed me to use PUT or DELETE method, for now i just use POST method to do update and delete.

#### Can we use class for controller ?

i am thinking of using class in controller instead, but i still not grasp the concept of callback function.
